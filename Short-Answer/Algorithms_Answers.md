#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) O(n) The calulations made doesn't change. The calulations required are fixed because of a single input


b) O(n^2) There is a nested operation that must be run for each element in the outer loop


c) O(n) We have a single operation and a single input

## Exercise II


I would implement a binary search tree for the floors. That way I cut my list of potentials for floor f in half with every evaluation. I stop when I reach a leaf. 

Runtime O(log(n))
